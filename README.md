# Resume Builder (reactjs & nodejs)

# • Link: https://hani-resume-builder.up.railway.app/  

A resume builder app that uses [jsPDF](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf) npm to make pdf files, that npm doesn't turn html to pdf; i just made both html and pdf part separately.    

***• Features:*** 
- The text in pdf file is selectable.   
- You can add a picture to it (up to 5 MB).    
- The ability to preview the resume and change colors before downloading.      
*Some languages doesn't show in the pdf file (like Arabic language) due to the way [jsPDF](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf) works.

*• Frontend:*   
- Reactjs hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext.   
- Npm packages: axios.

*• Backend:*   
- Nodejs: express.   
- Npm packages: jsPDF, multer, sharp.   
- Npm packages i used for development only:  env-cmd, nodemon.
